HTML:
* Navbar link for "Search Engine Optimization" connects to appropriate section.


HTML & CSS:
* <div> with class="header" changed to <header>, updated CSS selectors.
* Classes benefit-lead, benefit-brand, and benefit-cost were changed to benefit-card. All had the same styling and didn't need different classes. All respective CSS selectors were updated, duplicates deleted. 
* <div> with class="content", sub div's given class of content.card as they had same styling. Respective CSS selectors were updated, duplicates deleted. 
* Line 63 <img> had a closing tag, now removed. 
* The image under the navbar was loaded through CSS, I moved it into the HTML to make more sense.


CSS:
* 3 h3 selectors merged together. Had same styles. 
* Changed order of CSS selectors to go in the order they appear in the HTML. Two selectors untouched are .float-left and .float-right as they seem to make more sense next to each other and I didn't see a way to accomplish that with them being in chronological order.
